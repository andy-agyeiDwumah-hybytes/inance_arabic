### 5. Configure Firestore Security Rules

To allow your project to work correctly during development, update your Firestore rules
 to allow access to the required collections.

**NOTE: These rules are simplified for development purposes. In a production environment,
 consider adding proper authentication and validation to secure your data.**

```
rules_version = '2';

service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {

    // Allow create, update, and read operations in the 'users' collection
    match /users/{userId} {
      allow create, update, read: if true;
      allow delete: if false;
    }

    // Allow creation of documents in the 'mail' collection
    match /mail/{mailId} {
      allow create: if true;
      allow read, update, delete: if false;
    }
  }
}
```

### 6. Install Dependencies

`npm install`

### 7. Start The Development Server
